# Product Requirements Document: The Command Center Web Application

## Introduction/Overview

The Command Center is a centralized web application that serves as the definitive hub for managing user-generated content and profiles, complementing the existing Chrome Extension functionality. This platform addresses the fragmentation in user workflows by providing comprehensive CRUD operations for prompts, user profiles, and business profiles in a unified interface.

**Core Problem:** Users currently lack a centralized platform to comprehensively manage, organize, and refine their library of prompts and profile data, limiting long-term engagement and preventing users from maximizing the value of their created content.

**Goal:** Significantly increase user engagement and retention by delivering a unified and powerful platform experience that seamlessly integrates with the existing Chrome Extension workflow.

## Goals

1. **Centralized Management:** Provide a single web interface for users to manage all their prompts, user profiles, and business profiles
2. **Seamless Integration:** Ensure the web app works harmoniously with the existing Chrome Extension without disrupting current user workflows
3. **Enhanced User Experience:** Deliver a modern, responsive interface that works equally well on desktop and mobile devices
4. **Data Synchronization:** Enable real-time synchronization between the web app and Chrome Extension using Firebase SDK
5. **Scalable Architecture:** Build on a serverless, Jamstack architecture that can handle growth without performance degradation

## User Stories

1. **As a small business owner**, I want to access a web dashboard where I can see all my saved prompts in one place, so that I can organize and manage them more effectively than through the Chrome Extension alone.

2. **As a small business owner**, I want to edit my business profile information (business name and main product/service) through a web interface, so that I can easily update this information without needing to use the Chrome Extension.

3. **As a small business owner**, I want to create, edit, and delete prompts through a web interface, so that I can work on my prompt library more efficiently when I'm not actively responding to reviews.

4. **As a small business owner**, I want my changes in the web app to automatically sync with my Chrome Extension, so that I don't have to worry about data consistency between platforms.

5. **As a small business owner**, I want to access the web app from any device (desktop or mobile), so that I can manage my prompts and profiles regardless of where I am.

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication & Profile Management
1. The system must integrate with the existing Firebase Authentication system used by the Chrome Extension
2. The system must display user profile information (first name, last name, phone, email) that was collected during registration
3. The system must allow users to view their profile information in a read-only format
4. The system must maintain the same user creation workflow that already exists in the Chrome Extension

### Business Profile Management
5. The system must allow users to view and edit their business name
6. The system must allow users to view and edit their main selling product/service
7. The system must save business profile changes to the existing Firestore database structure
8. The system must display business profile information in a clear, organized format

### Prompt Management (CRUD Operations)
9. The system must display all user prompts in a list or grid format
10. The system must allow users to create new prompts through a form interface
11. The system must allow users to edit existing prompts through an inline or modal editor
12. The system must allow users to delete prompts with confirmation
13. The system must save all prompt changes to the existing Firestore database structure
14. The system must display prompts in a format that shows the prompt text and any associated metadata

### Data Synchronization
15. The system must use Firebase SDK to enable real-time data synchronization
16. The system must ensure that changes made in the web app are immediately available in the Chrome Extension
17. The system must fetch the latest data from Firestore when the web app loads
18. The system must handle the existing database structure without requiring schema changes

### User Interface
19. The system must use modern Shadcn UI components for consistent styling
20. The system must be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile devices
21. The system must provide an intuitive navigation structure for accessing different sections
22. The system must display loading states and error messages when appropriate
23. The system must use the existing Firebase project configuration and credentials

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Team collaboration features
- Public prompt-sharing marketplace
- Advanced user analytics dashboards
- Offline functionality
- Complex prompt categorization or tagging systems
- Prompt version history or templates
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- User permission management
- API endpoints for third-party integrations
- Advanced business profile fields beyond name and main product/service

## Design Considerations

- **UI Framework:** Use Shadcn UI components for modern, accessible design
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach ensuring equal functionality on all device sizes
- **Layout:** Clean, dashboard-style interface with clear navigation between sections
- **Color Scheme:** Consistent with existing brand colors and accessible contrast ratios
- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts that work well across different screen sizes
- **Spacing:** Consistent spacing using Tailwind CSS utilities for professional appearance

## Technical Considerations

- **Architecture:** Serverless, Jamstack architecture using Next.js on Vercel
- **Database:** Integrate with existing Firestore database structure without schema changes
- **Authentication:** Leverage existing Firebase Authentication system
- **Real-time Updates:** Use Firebase SDK for real-time data synchronization
- **API Routes:** Implement Next.js API routes for serverless backend functionality
- **State Management:** Use React hooks and context for client-side state management
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for Firebase operations
- **Performance:** Optimize for fast loading and smooth user interactions

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement:** 25% increase in average number of prompts saved per user within three months
- **Session Duration:** 30% increase in average user session duration within three months
- **Platform Adoption:** Successful migration of existing users from Chrome Extension-only to using both platforms
- **Data Consistency:** Zero reported data synchronization issues between web app and Chrome Extension
- **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback on the unified platform experience

## Open Questions

1. **Prompt Organization:** Should prompts be displayed in chronological order, alphabetical order, or allow user-defined sorting?
2. **Business Profile Validation:** What validation rules should apply to business name and product/service fields?
3. **Error Recovery:** How should the system handle cases where Firebase operations fail temporarily?
4. **User Onboarding:** Should there be a tutorial or help section for users transitioning from Chrome Extension-only to using both platforms?
5. **Performance Monitoring:** What specific metrics should be tracked to ensure the system meets performance requirements?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- User authentication integration
- Basic user profile display
- Business profile CRUD operations
- Prompt list display and basic CRUD operations
- Basic responsive design

### Phase 2 (Enhancement)
- Improved UI/UX refinements
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance optimizations
- User feedback integration

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Advanced prompt organization features
- Analytics and insights
- Team collaboration features
- Public marketplace integration
