### Notes

- Firebase configuration should use environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, project IDs).
- All components should be responsive and follow mobile-first design principles.
- Use Shadcn UI components for consistent styling across the application.
- **CRITICAL**: Firestore security rules must be implemented and tested before any data operations.
- Focus on V1 MVP functionality - advanced real-time features can be added post-launch.
- Test all functionality manually using `npm run dev` during development.
